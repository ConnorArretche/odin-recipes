    <ul>
      <li>1 lb ground beef (at least 80% lean)</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped onions</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped, or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh or 1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper sauce</li>
      <li>1 can (14.5 oz) Muir Glen™ organic diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
      <li>1 can (19 oz) Progresso™ red kidney beans, undrained</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In 3-quart saucepan, cook beef, onions and garlic over medium heat 8 to
        10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is thoroughly cooked;
        drain.

        Stir in chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper sauce and tomatoes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat just enough so mixture
        bubbles gently. Cover; cook 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in kidney beans. Heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce heat just
