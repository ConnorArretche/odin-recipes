    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      "This chicken enchilada recipe was actually one of the first-ever posts
      that I shared here on Gimme Some Oven back in 2009.</p>
      <p> And now, more than a
      decade later, it still continues to be one of the recipes I make most
      often for dinner here in our house — </p>
      <p>and one of the recipes that our
      readers make most often too! I'm so happy you all continue to enjoy it!</p>
    </p>
